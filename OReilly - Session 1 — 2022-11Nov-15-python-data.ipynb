    "- Machine learning -- let's use this existing data to make projections/predictions about the future.  How many people will buy at our Black Friday sale? How many toll collectors do we need at 6 a.m. on Sunday?  If we hear a certain soundwave, can we predict the meaning? If we see a picture, can we accurately predict the animal in the picture?\n",
